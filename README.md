<h2>ALTPROTON: Ontology for integration and interoperability of multi-aspect data of protein food production chains</h2>

The Alternative Protein Ontology (ALTPROTON) is the foundation of a cloud-based interoperable data platform specifically tailored to address the complexities of the protein food production chain. The ALTPROTON consists of three main domains food quality, sustainability, and food processing. The multi-aspect data generated within each domain are connected via the most representative concepts to effectively integrate and interoperable for future advancement in the food industry and protein food research sector. The paper describes the concepts, classes, and relationships used in ALTPROTON to fill the gaps in existing food ontologies and databases.
